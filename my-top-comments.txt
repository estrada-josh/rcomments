COMMENT BODY: It looks like a fake Instagram account made by someone who just wants to start shit like this. They have 2 posts and over 2K followers? Redflag. RA and Union Jack flag? Redflag. A random biblical quote that doesn't apply? Redflag. 

This just reeks like one of the Chinese/Russian accounts used to sew unrest and division on western socials. Knowing Ian is a figure that has exposed this in the past seems like a good target to help stir the pot. The messages also seem to be baiting him to do this?

Edit: Just found another account. Same deal. https://www.instagram.com/seanlol360__/

Edit 2: Here is another, found about 1 minute after the one above. https://www.instagram.com/seanlol36o/
Just search seanlol on the Instagram search bar. They are all the same.

NEW COMMENT:

COMMENT BODY: Vardy definitely gets called an athlete... KDB is nowhere near as strong or as big RLC. Not to mention Traore who looks like he could play in the NFL... that's why KDB doesn't get talked about in the same way-- not because he is white... 

This whole notion just rubs me the wrong way. It seems like people are thinking that players are being called pacy or strong just because they are black and not because they are actually pacy or strong. Need to give credit where its due. Everyone also conveniently ignores when black players are mentioned for something other than pace. 

Such as Pogba. Yes, he's known for his strength but he is also known for his passing, skill, composure, and silky style. But people in this thread say that people just talk about Pogba being strong. It's totally wrong. 

It is almost as if people want to brush off the fact that a black player is strong and pacy because they're black and "its a given" and focus on something else that is not as prominent in their game.

COMMENT BODY: Cmon... I think you're trying way too hard to find some racism here. 

He isn't unusually strong, he's average. His stamina and effort are what make him stand out. 

He definitely also gets praised for his technical skills but what makes him a stand out player is his effort complimented by his insane stamina. He gets praised for both. It's so clear to see on the field.

COMMENT BODY: The fact that he follows just as many is another indicator of a fake account. The reason is that it is indicative of using bots to follow many accounts automatically and buying followers ( which are also fake accounts ). This is used to make it seem like you have a big audience so you can attract people who would be willing to pay you to promote their products.
